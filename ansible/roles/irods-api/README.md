Since this role uses pip install, some requirements may change in the future.
The 2020 directory is kept for historical reasons.

For 2021, the Lexis wp3 apis have been augmented with ansible scripts for installation and deployment.
The role here has been simplified to perform the installation of pre-requisites only and download the
irods api code.
Use the api/ansible directory to configure and install the irods api.
